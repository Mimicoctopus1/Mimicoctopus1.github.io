      /*Now I have all I need to make the equation that the video ends with, but the video is missing something. The equation for a plane follows: ax+by+cz+d=0, but I don't have d. However, I can figure this out as explained in the link below:
      https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2686606/equation-of-a-plane-passing-through-3-points#:~:text=.-,To%20get,.,-The%20final%20equation
      However, this answer uses k instead of d, but it's really the same thing. Anyways, the simple solution is that the equation above â†— says that a, b, and c can be anything depending on what kind of plane you want, but x, y, and z are the coordinates of any point. If you put x, y, and z in, you can figure out if the left and right sides (of the equals (=) sign) are equal. If they are, the point is on the plane. If the left and right are not equal, then the point is not on the plane. So, let's say we use point p's coordinates for x, y, and z. Point p is on the plane, since that's basically the entire reason we created this function, to find a plane that goes on points p, q, and r. We could use q or r but I like p today, so we'll use p. However, remember that p might not make the equation true because we are missing d. So, what we will do is put in p and find a value for d that makes the left and right sides equal. We'll do it like this: if
      a(x-x0)+b(y-y0)+c(z-z0)+d=0
      and it should be true if we use p for x, y, and z:
      a(p.x-x0)+b(p.y-y0)+c(p.z-z0)+d=0.
      So, for just an example, let's say p is (1, 5, 3), just for simplicity.
      a(1-x0)+b(5-y0)+c(3-z0)+d=0
      And since I don't actually know the rest of the values, I'm just going to throw stuff, in; just assume that the values are correct. Let's say:
      a: 5
      x0: 8
      b: 5
      y0: 2
      c: 6
      z0: 1
      Then,
      a(1-x0)+b(5-y0)+c(3-z0)+d=0 becomes
      5(1-8)+5(5-2)+6(3-1)+d=0. Now, let's math it out.
      5(-7)+5(3)+6(2)+d=0
      -35+15+12+d=0
      -8+d=0 Okay. Now, we know -8 plus d must equal zero, since p is on the plane, but then only was -8 plus d is zero is if d = 8, since -8 + 8 equals 0.
      That means d = 8, no matter what any of the other values are. Now I have to make the computer do all that math for me. Now, notice that d was just the opposite of -8. I now just have to take -8 (or any other number that pops up) and reverse it. So:*/

      let d = -(   a(p.x-x0)+b(p.y-y0)+c(p.z-z0)   )
