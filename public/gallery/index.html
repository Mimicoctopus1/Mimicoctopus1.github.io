alt is the text that a screenreader will read. On an image it pops up when you hover your mouse over it. src is the file to get the 3D model from
src is the URL for the 3D model. <model-viewer> only accepts .glb and .gltf files.
skybox-image is the URL for the background. Use .jpg and .jpeg for best results.
environment-image is like skybox, only the image only shows up in reflective surfaces in the 3D model.
